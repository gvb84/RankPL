/**
 * Iterator that returns items associated with ranks in a 
 * low-to-high order. This represents a ranking function 
 * over items that can be iterated through from most 
 * plausible (rank 0) to least plausible.
 * 
 * The following rules must be satisfied:
 * 1: When a ranked iterator is constructed, its state is
 *    "not initialized". The methods getItem() and getRank()
 *    will return an undefined value.
 * 2: If calling next() returns true then getItem() and
 *    getRank() return the next item and associated rank.
 *    If next() returns false, their value is undefined.
 * 3: The first call to next() (unless it returns false) will
 *    make getRank() return 0.
 * 4: Every subsequent call to next() (unless it returns false) will
 *    make getRank() return a rank greater or equal than the 
 *    previously returned rank.
 *    
 * Note that it is allowed (although generally not desired) to return
 * the same item more than once. To filter out duplicates, use the 
 * DuplicateRemovingIterator.
